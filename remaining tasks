1. to fix the issue with the restart button not working correctly with worm spawning, and to remove the canvas elements like the player, worms, map before restarting the game. 
2. worms need to spawn in as soon as the start game button is clicked, and not as soon as the page opens.
3. need to implement an option where the user can change the length of time for the game. 
4. need to fix the issue where the sound "error.mp3" should be playing when the player misses a worm.
5. before the due date, update the game wireframe and storyboard to match the final version.
6. if I have time, change the life cycle of the worms to grow and shrink in size, and to respawn on the map in a different location.
